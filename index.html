            <p>
                Welcome! This site is created by students for students at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME), 
                Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics (VIK), Computer Engineering BSc program.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our goal is to share honest experiences and provide practical advice to help you make the most of your time at BME VIK.

                <h3>First Year Journey</h3>
                <p class="author">Anonymous Student, 2024</p>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>
                        <strong>The Challenge:</strong> The first year was intense. Mathematics, physics, and programming courses 
                        all at once can be overwhelming. The transition from high school to university-level thinking was the biggest hurdle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>What Helped:</strong> Forming study groups early on made a huge difference. We met regularly to 
                        discuss problem sets and prepare for exams together. Don't try to do everything alone!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Time management is everything. Start assignments early, attend consultations, 
                        and don't be afraid to ask questions during lectures.

                <h3>Balancing Theory and Practice</h3>
                <p class="author">Anonymous Student, 2023</p>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>
                        <strong>The Reality:</strong> While the theoretical foundation is strong at BME VIK, practical skills 
                        require extra effort outside the curriculum. This is both a challenge and an opportunity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>My Approach:</strong> I started working on personal projects and contributing to open-source. 
                        This not only improved my coding skills but also helped me understand how theory applies in real-world scenarios.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Advice:</strong> Don't wait until later semesters to start building practical experience. 
                        Start small projects, join student circles (körök), and attend hackathons.

                <h3>Laboratory Courses</h3>
                <p class="author">Anonymous Student, 2023</p>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>
                        <strong>The Experience:</strong> Laboratory courses are where theory meets practice. They can be time-consuming 
                        but are incredibly valuable for understanding how things actually work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Tips:</strong> Prepare before each lab session by reviewing the theory and the lab manual. 
                        This saves so much time during the actual lab work. Also, make friends with your lab partners - you'll 
                        need each other's support.
